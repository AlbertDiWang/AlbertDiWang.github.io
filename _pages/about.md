Welcome! My name is Albert Di Wang.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in Accounting and minoring in Financial Economics and Econometrics. I hold a Master's degree in Accounting from UT Austin and a Master's degree in Financial Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Financial Management from [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on the **real effects of SEC and PCAOB regulations** and the **role of Artificial Intelligence in capital markets**. In my second-year summer paper, I document a significant decline in U.S. attractiveness to foreign listings over the past two decades. Leveraging the staggered introduction of PCAOB international inspections, I identify U.S. international regulatory oversight as a significant contributor to this prolonged trend.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a machine learning engineer at [JD.COM](https://corporate.jd.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I led the development of algorithms for consumer credit risk modeling, return freight insurance pricing, and personalized recommendation system. I was also affiliated with the Joint Lab in Financial Technology and Engineering with [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"}, where I began my research journey in FinTech consumer credit.

In my spare time, I enjoy weight training, playing basketball, playing electric/acoustic guitar, and cooking.
