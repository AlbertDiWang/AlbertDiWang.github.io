    <h1>Welcome! My name is Albert Di Wang.</h1> 
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>
        I am a third-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">McCombs School of Business</a>, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, majoring in Accounting and minoring in Financial Economics and Econometrics. I hold a Master's degree in Accounting from UT Austin and a Master's degree in Financial Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Financial Management from <a href="https://e.swufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics</a>.

        My research focuses on the <strong>real effects of SEC and PCAOB regulations</strong> and the <strong>role of Artificial Intelligence in capital markets</strong>. In my second-year summer paper, I document a significant decline in U.S. attractiveness to foreign listings over the past two decades. Leveraging the staggered introduction of PCAOB international inspections, I identify U.S. international regulatory oversight as a significant contributor to this prolonged trend.

        Before my Ph.D., I worked as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://corporate.jd.com/" target="_blank">JD.COM</a>, where I led the development of algorithms for consumer credit risk modeling, return freight insurance pricing, and personalized recommendation system. I was also affiliated with the Joint Lab in Financial Technology and Engineering with <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">City University of Hong Kong</a>, where I began my research journey in FinTech consumer credit.
    </p>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>In my spare time, I enjoy weight training, playing basketball, playing electric/acoustic guitar, and cooking.</p>
