**1. Has the U.S. Become Less Attractive to Foreign Companies?**\
\- with Shuping Chen and Nick Hallman, 2023\
\- developed from my second-year summer paper\
\- presented at FARS 2024, HARC 2024, UT Austin, ASU\*, HKUST\*, CityUHK\*

**Abstract**: We document a significant decline in the United States (U.S.) as a destination for foreign listings over the past two decades. Leveraging the staggered introduction of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) international inspections across 55 countries worldwide, we investigate the role of the PCAOB regulatory oversight in contributing to this prolonged trend. Our stacked difference-in-differences analyses demonstrate that companies are less likely to pursue U.S. listings when doing so exposes their audits to PCAOB inspections. This deterrent effect is concentrated: (1) among companies for whom PCAOB inspections likely impose greater compliance costs, (2) in industries foreign governments are likely to view as important for national security, and (3) in countries with which the U.S. is experiencing more political tension. Placebo tests show that there is no similar reduction in foreign listings to non-U.S. markets after the PCAOB gains inspection access in companiesâ€™ home countries; indeed, listings to some non-U.S. markets increase, suggesting that companies from PCAOB-impacted countries shift their listings to non-U.S. host countries to avoid inspection.

**2. Deciphering the Impact of BigTech Consumer Credit**\
\- with Lei Chen, Wenlan Qian, and Qi Wu, 2024\
\- presented at NBER Chinese Economy 2024\* (scheduled), SFS Cavalcade North America 2024, UT Austin

**Abstract**: BigTechs' integration of financing with their core business provides them with an unprecedented informational advantage over FinTechs and traditional banks, but also raises concerns about the potential abuse of collected personal data. Using a novel dataset from a leading e-commerce BigTech, we address two under-examined questions raised by this integration: (1) How does BigTech credit (financing) impact consumer online shopping behavior (core business)? and (2) Does BigTech credit lead to overspending? In a randomized context, we observe a universal boost in consumer engagement with the e-commerce platform in terms of visit intensity (12%), visit-to-purchase conversion (8%), and spending (19%). These effects are more pronounced among individuals with limited access to traditional credit, lower prior engagement, and residing in areas with advanced logistics. Further analysis reveals only a modest 4% increase in average order value, but a significant 20% increase in the frequency and variety of purchases. Despite these increases, we find no evidence of higher discretionary spending or purchases of more expensive items. Additionally, neither higher credit limits nor increased spending are associated with higher delinquency rates. Further investigations indicate that the BigTech adjusts credit limits based on consumers' repayment abilities, effectively directing the consumption boost and preventing over-indebtedness.
